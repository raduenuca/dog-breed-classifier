*Dog-Breed Classifier Project: Udacity - Deep Learning Nanodegree Program*

## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/raduenuca/dog-breed-classifier.git
		cd dog-breed-classifier
	```
	
2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-breed-classifier/data/dog_images`.  The `dog_images/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.
3. Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location ``path/to/dog-breed-classifier/data/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 
4. Make sure you have already installed the necessary Python packages

    ```
        conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

5. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.
